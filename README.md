# 👋 Hey there, I'm Imtiaj!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Software Developer passionate about building scalable web apps, backend services, and AI-driven platforms. I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant solutions and love shipping clean, production-ready code.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎯 Passionate about crafting intuitive user experiences and building systems that scale.
- 🧠 🧠 Curious by nature — I love diving deep into how things work and simplifying complexity through code.
- ✍️ I care about code readability, performance, and writing with purpose—whether it's logic, UI, or documentation.
- 🧪 Strong believer in learning by building — I experiment often, fail fast, and improve with each iteration.
- 🤝 I enjoy collaborating in fast-moving environments where ideas are valued over hierarchy.
- 🌱 Always growing — be it through solving real-world problems, exploring new design patterns, or just asking better questions.
